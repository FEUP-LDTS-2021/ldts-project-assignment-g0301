- Experience system, meaning that you earn experience points by playing that can be used to unlock new and better vehicles and different cenarios.
- Powerups that can be picked up in the arena, providing extra habilities to the player that picks them.
- Different game modes, for instance, single-player classic, 1v1 with 2 players, survival, where different bots will be spawning and quickgame, where the walls of the arena will be constantly closing in.
- Boost bar.
